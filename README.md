# 🚀 React Genesis: Mastering Next.js Setup

A starter project for building modern web applications with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. Inspired by Airbnb’s interface, this project focuses on property listings with images, ratings, and interactive components — while applying best practices in modern front-end development.

## 📘 Project Description

This Next.js-based application is designed to help you learn and practice building scalable, maintainable web applications. You'll implement a simplified version of Airbnb’s UI using:

- ✅ React
- ✅ Next.js (Pages Router)
- ✅ TypeScript
- ✅ Tailwind CSS
- ✅ ESLint

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll be able to:

- Scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript
- Understand the Next.js folder structure and organizational best practices
- Implement basic routing using the Pages Router
- Create reusable and typed React components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Manage assets and static files in a Next.js app
- Compose components effectively
- Design responsively with Tailwind CSS
- Configure ESLint for consistent code quality

## 🧱 Best Practices

### 📁 Project Structure

- `components/` – All reusable UI components
- `interfaces/` – Centralized TypeScript interfaces
- `pages/` – Follows Next.js Pages Router conventions

### 🧩 Component Design

- Components use TypeScript for strong typing
- All props are typed via interfaces
- Components are small, focused, and reusable

### ✨ Code Quality

- ESLint is used to enforce consistent code style
- TypeScript ensures static type safety
- Arrow functions are used consistently

### 🎨 Styling

- Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling
- Responsive design is implemented using Tailwind breakpoints
- Consistent spacing and typography are maintained

### ⚡ Performance

- Next.js `Image` component is used for optimized image loading
- Automatic code splitting via Next.js
- Only necessary dependencies are included for minimal bloat
